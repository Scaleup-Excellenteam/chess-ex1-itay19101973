mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./Chess 
```

Any project that does not compile properly using these steps will not be graded.


## How to Submit an Exercise
You are required to submit each exercise using "GitHub Classroom". To do this, you must upload a link to your "GitHub Classroom" repository via Moodle..

### Branching and Pull Request Guidelines

- ðŸš¨ Your `main` branch **must remain clean and stable** at all times. Never push directly to `main`.  
- Create a **new branch** from `main` for each exercise (e.g., `exercise1`, `feature/queen-movement`, etc.).  
- Work on those branches and push your changes there.  
- Once you're done, open a **Pull Request (PR)** from your branch where all the changes where made into `main`.  
- In the PR, review your changes carefully using GitHubâ€™s diff viewer.  
- Make sure all checks pass (e.g., linter, build).  
- After merging the PR into `main`, you can submit the repository link via Moodle.


### Pre-submission Checkup
1. Make sure you've answered all the questions.  
2. Review and refactor your code for better readability (ideally, review your code one or two days later â€” sometimes it's better to review with fresh eyes).  
3. Ensure that all intended files are uploaded to Git and follow the structure convention outlined in the [Repository Structure](#repository-structure) section.  
4. Ensure that your code is running.  
5. Once you open a PR, review the changes **carefully**. You can leverage GitHub's built-in diff viewer.  
6. Wait and confirm that the linter test completed successfully. If the linter test fails, assess the errors and refactor accordingly â€” otherwise, each error will negatively impact your grade.  
7. Make sure you followed the [Branching and Pull Request Guidelines](#branching-and-pull-request-guidelines).  
8. Upload the repository link to Moodle.  
9. Good luck :)

# Chess Move Recommender Algorithm

## Overview

The `MoveRecommender` class implements an intelligent chess move recommendation system using a **minimax algorithm with position evaluation**. 
The algorithm analyzes potential moves for the current player and ranks them based on their strategic value,
considering both immediate tactical advantages and future opponent responses.

## Algorithm Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Move Generation**: Systematically generates all legal moves for the current player
2. **Position Evaluation**: Scores each position using multiple chess heuristics
3. **Minimax Search**: Looks ahead to evaluate opponent responses
4. **Priority Queue**: Maintains ranked list of best moves

### Key Features

- **Minimax with Limited Depth**: Recursive lookahead with configurable maximum depth
- **Multi-Factor Position Evaluation**: Considers captures, checks, center control, threats, and piece safety
- **Temporary Move Simulation**: Makes and undoes moves to evaluate positions safely
- **Early Termination**: Alpha-beta style cutoffs for performance optimization

## How the Algorithm Works

### 1. Move Generation Phase (`refreshMoveQueue`)

```
For each square on the board:
    If square contains our piece:
        For each possible destination:
            If move is legal:
                Evaluate move using minimax
                Add to priority queue if score > 0
```

**Time Complexity**: O(64 Ã— 64 Ã— M) where M is the minimax evaluation cost
- 64 source squares Ã— 64 destination squares = 4,096 potential moves per turn
- Most moves are filtered out by chess rules, reducing actual evaluations significantly

### 2. Minimax Evaluation (`minimax`)

The minimax algorithm implements the following recursive structure:

```
minimax(move, depth, isMaximizing):
    currentScore = evaluatePosition(move)
    
    if depth == 0:
        return currentScore
    
    makeTemporaryMove(move)
    bestScore = isMaximizing ? -âˆž : +âˆž
    
    For each opponent response:
        score = minimax(opponentMove, depth-1, !isMaximizing)
        if isMaximizing:
            bestScore = max(bestScore, score)
        else:
            bestScore = min(bestScore, score)
    
    restoreBoard()
    return currentScore + bestScore/depth
```

**Key Optimizations**:
- **Early Cutoff**: Stops searching when finding moves above/below threshold values
- **Depth Scaling**: Divides deeper scores by depth to prefer immediate tactical gains
- **No-Move Detection**: Recognizes checkmate/stalemate conditions

### 3. Position Evaluation (`evaluatePosition`)

The position evaluation function considers multiple strategic factors:

#### Scoring Components

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Material Capture** | Piece Value Ã— Multiplier | Points for capturing opponent pieces |
| **Check Bonus** | Fixed Value | Bonus for putting opponent in check |
| **Center Control** | Positional Bonus | Rewards controlling center squares (d4, d5, e4, e5) |
| **King Safety** | Penalty | Discourages unnecessary king moves |
| **Threat Assessment** | Variable Penalty | Penalizes moves that expose pieces to capture |
| **Randomness** | Small Random Value | Adds variation to prevent predictable play |

#### Piece Values (Standard Chess Values)
- **Pawn**: 1 point
- **Knight**: 3 points  
- **Bishop**: 3 points
- **Rook**: 5 points
- **Queen**: 9 points
- **King**: 1000 points (effectively infinite)

#### Center Control Evaluation
- **Inner Center** (d4, d5, e4, e5): Higher bonus
- **Outer Center** (12 surrounding squares): Lower bonus
- Encourages piece development and central control

#### Threat Assessment
The algorithm checks if the moved piece becomes vulnerable:
- **Heavy Penalty**: When attacked by a piece of lower value
- **Standard Penalty**: When attacked by piece of equal/higher value
- **Calculation**: Scans all opponent pieces to see if they can capture the moved piece

## Runtime Complexity Analysis

### Theoretical Complexity

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(B^D Ã— E)

Where:
- **B** = Branching factor (average legal moves per position) â‰ˆ 35 in chess
- **D** = Maximum search depth
- **E** = Position evaluation cost â‰ˆ O(64) for threat analysis

### Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. Move Generation: O(64Â² Ã— V)
- **64Â² iterations**: Check all source-destination pairs
- **V**: Move validation cost (piece-specific rules)
- **Practical reduction**: Most combinations are illegal, reducing actual work

#### 2. Minimax Search: O(B^D)
- **Recursive calls**: Each level explores ~35 legal moves
- **Exponential growth**: Depth 1 = 35 calls, Depth 3 = 42,875 calls
- **With optimizations**: Early cutoffs reduce effective branching factor

#### 3. Position Evaluation per Move: O(64)
- **Threat analysis**: Check all 64 squares for attacking pieces
- **Other factors**: O(1) calculations for captures, checks, center control

### Practical Performance

| Max Depth | Estimated Evaluations | Typical Runtime |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | ~35 | < 1ms |
| 2 | ~1,000 | 10-50ms |
| 3 | ~35,000 | 0.5-2s |
| 4 | ~1,000,000 | 30-120s |

**Performance Factors**:
- **Position complexity**: Endgames have fewer pieces, reducing branching
- **Early cutoffs**: Alpha-beta style pruning reduces search space
- **Move ordering**: Priority queue ensures best moves are found first

### Memory Complexity: O(D)
- **Stack space**: Recursive calls use O(D) stack frames
- **Board states**: Each level saves/restores one board state
- **Move storage**: Priority queue holds all evaluated moves

## Algorithm Strengths

1. **Tactical Awareness**: Identifies captures, checks, and immediate threats
2. **Strategic Understanding**: Values center control and piece development  
3. **Lookahead Capability**: Considers opponent responses to avoid blunders
4. **Configurable Depth**: Adjustable between fast play and stronger analysis
5. **Robust Evaluation**: Multiple factors prevent one-dimensional play

## Algorithm Limitations

1. **Exponential Complexity**: Deep searches become computationally expensive
2. **Limited Horizon**: Cannot see beyond maximum depth setting
3. **Static Evaluation**: Position scoring based on heuristics, not perfect chess knowledge
4. **No Opening/Endgame Specialization**: Uses same evaluation throughout game phases
5. **Threat Assessment Scope**: Only evaluates immediate piece safety

## Usage Example

```cpp
// Initialize with board and search depth
MoveRecommender recommender(chessBoard, 3);

// Generate and evaluate all moves
recommender.recommendMoves();

// Display best moves in order
recommender.printRecommendations();
```

## Configuration Parameters

- **maxDepth**: Controls search depth (1-4 recommended)
- **ALPHA_BETA_CUTOFF**: Threshold for early termination
- **CAPTURE_MULTIPLIER**: Weight for material gains
- **CHECK_BONUS**: Bonus for checking opponent
- **CENTER_BONUS_INNER/OUTER**: Positional control values
- **THREAT_MULTIPLIER/PENALTY**: Threat assessment weights
